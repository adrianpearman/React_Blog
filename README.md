Generic React/Redux Blog application.

The main purpose of this application was to highlight the ability to create a simple blog site that allows for a user to create a new post, the ability to view the post and the ability to delete a post.

The app was built with the assistance and guidance of Stephen Griders uDemy course.

Future updates will include:
1 - Log in functionality for a user to make the deletioon of the posts while giving guests the ability to view the created posts
2 - Change the site styling to allow for a more modern and enjoyable viewing experience.
3 - Incorporating a comments section that will allow each post to have its own dedicated comments section
4 - Migrate to a different database hosting site to allow greater control on database information.
